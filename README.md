# A parallel tabu search algorithm for solving quadratic assignment problems

A group project in ST444 Computational Data Science

The objective is to design a parallel tabu search algorithm for solving the quadratic assignment problems

The code in this project is 100% written by me.

Please find the python code in parallel_tabu_search.py
